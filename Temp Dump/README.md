This is a working copy of the Ieneko42c QMK source code https://github.com/darakuneko/keyboard/tree/main/qmk/ieneko42c. It was able to compiled under 0.24.2 repo with no issues. I only had to remove the outdated VIAL variables and a USB Sleep variable but the core part of the code compiles. Next step would need to find time to parse and integrate the Ballz Out matrix layout into the Ieneko42c and it is game.

This Temp Dump folder contains both the QMK compiled firmware and the QMK source code for the working Ieneko42c. Use these files for reference. These codes are not ready for Ballz Out trackpad functions yet. 03.27.2024
